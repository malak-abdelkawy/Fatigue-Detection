# Fatigue Detection System

A deep learning-based system for detecting fatigue in human faces using EfficientNet-B0 with Flask API and web interface.

---

## Problem Definition

### Overview
Fatigue detection is a critical safety concern across multiple domains. Traditional methods rely on manual observation, wearable sensors, or self-reporting, all of which have significant limitations in accuracy, scalability, and user comfort.

### The Challenge
- Traffic accidents caused by drowsy driving
- Workplace injuries in high-risk environments
- Reduced productivity and performance
- Health complications from chronic fatigue

### Our Solution
An automated, non-intrusive computer vision system that analyzes facial images to classify individuals as Active or Fatigued. The system provides real-time predictions with confidence scores through a simple web interface.

### Applications
- Transportation: Monitor driver alertness to prevent accidents
- Industrial Safety: Track worker fatigue in hazardous environments
- Healthcare: Assess patient energy and recovery levels
- Education: Monitor student engagement and attention

## System Overview

### Architecture
The system consists of three main components:
1. Deep learning model (EfficientNet-B0) trained on facial images
2. Flask REST API for model inference
3. Web interface for user interaction

### Workflow
1. User uploads an image through the web interface
2. Image is sent to Flask API as base64 encoded data
3. API preprocesses the image and runs model inference
4. Model returns prediction (Active/Fatigue) with confidence score
5. Results are displayed in the web interface with probability distribution

### Model Design
**Base Architecture**: EfficientNet-B0 pre-trained on ImageNet

**Custom Classifier**:
- Dropout layer (p=0.7) for regularization
- Fully connected layer (1280 to 512 features)
- Batch normalization for training stability
- GELU activation function
- Additional dropout layer (p=0.7)
- Output layer (512 to 2 classes)

**Training Configuration**:
- Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay (1e-3)
- Learning rate: 3e-4 to 8e-4 using OneCycleLR scheduler
- Batch size: 32
- Maximum epochs: 25 with early stopping (patience=7)
- Loss function: CrossEntropyLoss with label smoothing (0.1)

**Data Augmentation**:
- Random horizontal flip (50%)
- Random vertical flip (20%)
- Random rotation (±30 degrees)
- Color jitter (brightness, contrast, saturation, hue)
- Random affine transformations (translation, scale, shear)
- Normalization: mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]

## Key Insights

### What Works Well
- Transfer learning with pre-trained weights significantly improves accuracy and reduces training time
- Heavy data augmentation prevents overfitting and improves model generalization
- OneCycleLR scheduler accelerates convergence compared to static learning rates
- High dropout rates (0.7) effectively combat overfitting on limited datasets
- Label smoothing improves model calibration and confidence scores

### Lessons Learned
- Data quality and preprocessing are as important as model architecture
- Proper regularization techniques are essential for preventing overfitting
- Learning rate scheduling has a significant impact on final model performance
- User interface design and API integration require careful planning
- Model interpretability and confidence scores are crucial for real-world deployment
